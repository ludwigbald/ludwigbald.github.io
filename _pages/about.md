Previously, I was a Master's student in Machine Learning at Uni TÃ¼bingen, Germany.
I'm proud of my [thesis project about Uncertainty in Reinforcement Learning for Demand Response in Energy Systems](https://github.com/ludwigbald/msc-thesis),
supervised by [Nicole Ludwig](https://www.mlsustainableenergy.com/).

During my Bachelor's studies in Cognitive Science, I studied abroad in Trento, Italy and did an internship as a Data Scientist at King Games, working on Candy Crush Saga in Stockholm.

Among other things, my current interests include:
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), a global community that's trying to do as much good as possible.
- [Trying to save Social Media](https://twitter.com/LudwigBald/status/1263755951951273985) that should be possible to fix if social media had better incentives.
- Bouldering
- Music (I sing in the [Indie Pop Chor Berlin](https://www.singdichgluecklich.de/indiepopchor))
- Trying to improve my Photography
